# Guildcord V2
## Improved performance and a RestAPI
Guildcord is the link between discord and guilded.

### Before setting up
This code are _**our**_ API and bots that runs on our own servers. If you have problem setting it up or have problems while its running, it is probably a not changed value in the code.
#### **__There are placeholder e.g. in endpoints or in Bot/guilded_servers which need to be deleted before running the code.__**

### Setting up

1. Install the `requirements.txt`

2. The bot codes need to be change before you want to use them, **if you set up your own API**. If not, these can be ignored.

3. First change the `config.py` and enter your bot tokens. **If you are running the api on your own, enter a master token to generate new tokens and to give the bots access to the endpoints globally**.

4. Run your wanted python files.

### Bugs
If you encounter bugs, errors or other things feel fre to contact me or open a issue/pull request.
If you change your code in any way that isn't supposed to change and bugs/errors occour, than **dont** contact me to ask why xyz isn't working!
